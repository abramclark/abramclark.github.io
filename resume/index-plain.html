<strong class='h2'>About Me and Objective</strong>
<p>I live in Seattle with my cats and wife - currently passionate about building AI tools,
biking, and mechanical engineering prototypes with 3D printing. After 7 years in shipping logistics, I automated myself into redundancy, then was caught in a 50% downsize. I'm now looking for new problems to solve and learn from involving:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Machine learning / ANNs / AI</li>
  <li>Data analytics and pipelines</li>
  <li>System architecture and schema design</li>
  <li>Building search engines and data visualization tools; document vectors, knowledge retrieval, informatics</li>
</ul></p>

  Developing reliable API services with Python, MySQL, Rust, Ruby, Kafka, and many other tools.
  <ul>
    <li>Led the design and implementation of an in-house address verification system that
      replaced a slow, unreliable, and expensive external API call. The final service was
      implemented in Rust, runs 50x faster and has had no service level outages, and
      resulted in large annual savings.
    <li>Designed and implemented multiple extractions from an overloaded monolith and DB.
      They were completed on time with no break in service or changes in API behavior.
      This included rigorous testing and careful migrations.
    <li>Participated in design and implementation of the back end for new API products:
      carbon offsets, insurance purchases, and analytics tools for customers. The last
      also powers a web based analytics tool, and continues to perform well for real-time
      queries as we grow.
    <li>Teach architecture, schema design, and language concepts to junior developers
  </ul>

<strong class='h2'>About Me</strong>
<p>I've been fascinated with programming since teaching myself QBASIC during 4th to 7th
    grade. Even after 20 years of experience in the industry, I still find it really
    satisfying when a complex assembly of logic proves to be correct by compiling and
running as designed.</p>
