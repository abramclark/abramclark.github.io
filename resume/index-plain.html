  Developing reliable API services with Python, MySQL, Rust, Ruby, Kafka, and many other tools.
  <ul>
    <li>Led the design and implementation of an in-house address verification system that
      replaced a slow, unreliable, and expensive external API call. The final service was
      implemented in Rust, runs 50x faster and has had no service level outages, and
      resulted in large annual savings.
    <li>Designed and implemented multiple extractions from an overloaded monolith and DB.
      They were completed on time with no break in service or changes in API behavior.
      This included rigorous testing and careful migrations.
    <li>Participated in design and implementation of the back end for new API products:
      carbon offsets, insurance purchases, and analytics tools for customers. The last
      also powers a web based analytics tool, and continues to perform well for real-time
      queries as we grow.
    <li>Teach architecture, schema design, and language concepts to junior developers
  </ul>

  Conceived of and created a social media creativity platform.
  <ul>
    <li>My responsibilities: UX design, architecture, the majority of programming, hiring
      technical team, management, and some business development.
    <li>Developed full stack using Python, MongoDB, JavaScript, AWS, Git, and Google
      Analytics. The core of this was a sophisticated web based drag and drop design
      tool, coupled with a social frame that handled tagging, feeds, and comments.
    <li>Managed and grew the platform to thousands of international users (analytics shows
      115 countries).

<strong class='h2'>About Me</strong>
<p>I've been fascinated with programming since teaching myself QBASIC in middle
school. Even after 20 years of experience in the industry, I still find it
fundamentally satisfying when a complex assembly of logic proves to be correct
by compliing and running as designed.</p>

Over the years I've found certain areas of building software to be particularly engaging:
<ul>
  <li>Data analytics</li>
  <li>Systems and interfaces for information / knowledege retrieval</li>
  <li>Architecture and schema design</li>
  <li>Novel interactive web apps</li>
</ul>

I thrive on solving challenging problems and continuously improving my skills.
Whether it's designing elegant architectures, uncovering insights through data,
or creating intuitive user experiences, I enjoy making functional innovative
software.
